Adobe Launch - Mapping Table
============================

Provides a rich and versatile mapping table data element.

Supports four different methods:
* Exact matches
* Case insensitive matches
* Starts with
* Contains

Further the output can be static or another data element to offer even more flexibility.
E.g. ideal for implementing multiple marketing pixels.

A **detailed walk through** of some use cases can be found in the [Tutorial PDF](doc/mapping-table-tutorial.pdf).
